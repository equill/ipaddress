# ipaddress - an IP address manipulation libary

Building on a fork of [cl-cidr-notation](https://github.com/AccelerationNet/cl-cidr-notation), this libary adds IPv6 support and OO wrappers around manipulation and comparison of addresses and subnets.

The API is modelled on the [Python ipaddress module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html).
